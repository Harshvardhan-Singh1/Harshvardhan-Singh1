# Welcome to Harshvardhan Singh's GitHub Profile

Hi! I'm Harshvardhan Singh

My passion lies within a variety of domains such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics. I am deeply invested in Statistics, Computational Social Sciences, Astronomy, Healthcare, Finance and Business Intelligence, exploring how they intersect with my primary areas of interest. I am also working on a project fine tuning LLMs.

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at the University of Arizona. Here, I'm engaged in an exciting research initiative, referred to as "Project Apollo". This project is based on uncovering historical trends in research works in the field of Astronomy and astrophysics. We want to study the trends and patterns in which information is shared in International Collaboration. In my study, I employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and conduct Network Analysis on a vast dataset, pioneering a novel approach in the context of Astronomy. This methodology is particularly groundbreaking in terms of topic modeling and citation network analysis, setting a new precedent for analytical techniques within the field. In order to better explain my project, I will talk about 3 overarching tasks containing their own set of sub-tasks. First task is to understand which countries contribute to different topics within the field of Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am using the very recently developed Structural Topic Modeling algorithm which is more advanced than LDA model because it also incorporates metadata into the model in order to produce a more nuanced set of topics. Second task is to identify the set of telescopes, satellites and arrays utilized by different countries to perform their research. This task is challenging because the data is unlabeled and requires a combination of manual labeling and classification algorithm with weak supervision. Third task is to perform Network Analysis to understand the patterns in which flow of Information and collaboration takes place among different countries and institutions.

As part of my collaborative work, I am contributing to the following GitHub repositories:

- [Skin Cancer Progression Pilot Project](https://github.com/ISTA421INFO521/Skin-Cancer-Progression)
- [Classifying Astronomical Transients](https://github.com/astrochialinko/INFO523-Final-Project/tree/Harsh)  (currently private on GitHub, please reach out for a zoom meeting project demonstration)
