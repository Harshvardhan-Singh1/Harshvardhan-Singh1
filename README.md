# Welcome to Harshvardhan Singh's GitHub Profile

Hi! I'm Harshvardhan Singh

My passion lies within a variety of domains such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics. I am deeply invested in Computational Social Sciences, Finance, and Business Intelligence, exploring how they intersect with my primary areas of interest.

Currently, I'm advancing my understanding and expertise in the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms within Finance and Business settings. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to devise solutions for complex problems in these fields.

As part of my collaborative work, I am contributing to the following GitHub repositories:

- [Classifying Astronomical Transients](https://github.com/astrochialinko/INFO523-Final-Project/tree/Harsh) - A project focused on the categorization of variable cosmic phenomena.
- [Skin Cancer Progression Pilot Project]([git@github.com:ISTA421INFO521/Skin-Cancer-Progression.git](https://github.com/ISTA421INFO521/Skin-Cancer-Progression)) - A pilot study focused on the progression of skin cancer.

In addition to this, I'm serving as a Research Assistant at the School of Information, University of Arizona, Tucson, where I continue to apply and improve my skills.

To get in touch, please reach out via email: harsh24111@gmail.com.
