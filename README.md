# Welcome to Harshvardhan Singh's GitHub Profile

Hi! I'm Harshvardhan Singh

My passion lies within a variety of domains such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics. I am deeply invested in Computational Social Sciences, Astronomy, Healthcare, Finance and Business Intelligence, exploring how they intersect with my primary areas of interest.

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of Arizona's School of Information in Tucson. Here, I'm engaged in an exciting initiative, referred to as "Project Apollo". This project provides me an opportunity to further hone my research skills by delving into the vast cosmos of knowledge in fields like Cosmology, Astronomy, and Astrophysics. I'm employing advanced tools such as SciBERT, keyATM, and LDA for effective text analysis. This work not only challenges me but also fuels my passion for uncovering the mysteries of the universe. While I am enthusiastic about engaging in discussions around this project, discretion is currently a priority given the exploratory nature of our research. I invite you to reach out to me privately for a more detailed conversation.

As part of my collaborative work, I am contributing to the following GitHub repositories:
